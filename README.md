# About the repository 

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to VLSI Physical Design for ASICs using open-source tools! Here, we embark on a journey that starts with processor specifications and leverages the power of the RISC-V ISA. We'll build processors from scratch, taking them through the entire RTL to GDS process  that meets various Performance, Power, Area ( PPA ) and manufacturability requirements. The best part? We're doing it all with open-source tools, including the RISC-V toolchain and OpenLane anad many more .
